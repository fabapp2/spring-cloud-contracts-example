# Contracts in a remote repository

With this approach the contracts will be kept in a jar and stored in a central remote repository, e.g Nexus or Artifactory.

NOTE: This approach is useful in cases when consumers and producers are written in Java or Kotlin and consumers cannot access the producer repository.

## Setup

### contracts project

See the link:/contracts[contracts project]

The project will have a link:{path-to-contracts-pom}[`pom.xml`] to generate a jar using `maven-assembly-plugin`.
The generated jar will contain the contracts and a link:{path-to-contracts-internal-pom}[`pom.xml`]
which will be used by the consumer(s) to generate the stubs and by the producer to generate the tests.

### consumer project

See the link:/consumer[consumer project]

The consumer(s) will need to checkout the contract project and build a jar with the generated stubs and install it into their local maven repository
 doing a `mvn clean install -DskipTests`. using this link:{path-to-contracts-internal-pom}[`pom.xml`]. +

IMPORTANT: It is important to skip the tests as the `spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin` otherwise tries to generate the tests for the producer which will fail.

To use the generated stubs in client tests we use the `@AutoConfigureStubRunner` annotation like this:

[source, java]
----
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(
		ids = "com.example.scc:producer:+:stubs",
		stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL)
----

### producer project

See the link:/producer[producer project]

On the producer side we need to declare the repository url and the dependency which includes the contracts.
When running a `mvn clean install` this artifact will be used to generate the SCC tests.

            </plugin>
----

<1> define the url of the repository
<2> define the artifact which has the contracts (sure, it must be available in the repository)

## Running the example

. Run the client tests against the generated stubs
.. `mvn clean install -DskipTests`. using this link:{path-to-contracts-internal-pom}[`pom.xml`] should be enough.
. Create the jar containing the contracts.
.. run a `mvn clean assembly:single` using this link:{path-to-contracts-pom}[`pom.xml`] to generate the jar with contracts
.. You can check the content running a `jar -tf target/contracts-0.0.1.jar`
. deploy generated jar to artifactory
.. Start a local Artifactory server: `docker run  -p 8085:8081 docker_artifactory` (or any  other image)
.. login to your local http://localhost:8085[artifactory] using username `admin` with password `password` as credentials.
.. click `artifacts` an then `upload` or `deploy` in the upper right corner
.. enter `com.example.scc:contracts:<version>` as upload information
. Run the test for the producer
